# The test

The test is to implement a class that can analyze whether a Soduko-board is solved.  

A soduko-board is solved when each row, column and block contains all the number from 1-9.  

Thus you need to implement a function that can extract a row, extract a column and extract a block from a given board.  

The unit-tests are there - you succeed when they are green.  

GLHF!
