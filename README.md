Developer-Test for Javascript
=======================

## To run
`````````
 git clone git@github.com:JulianDuniec/DeveloperTestJavascript.git
 cd DeveloperTestJavascript/
 npm install
 npm test
 `````````
 
## The test

The test is to implement a class that can analyze whether a Soduko-board is solved. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku  

A soduko-board is solved when each row, column and block contains all the numbers from 1-9 in any order.  

Thus you need to implement a function that can extract a row, extract a column and extract a block from a given board.  

The unit-tests are there - you succeed when they are green.  

GLHF!
